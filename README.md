#PUBLISHING CONVERTER

The hybrid publishing converter is a tool that converts publications formats into others, in a durable, high-quality, design caring, hybrid publishing way.

“Hybrid publishing”, in short, refers to contemporary practices of producing different publications formats (paper books, ebooks, web contents…) in a connected and complementary way.
The production of a publications layout is informed by the tools used and the culture embedded in these tools. There isn’t one “way” of doing layout but rather traditions, conventions and a series of tools, more or less accessible, more or less taught and used. The approach here isn’t to build one tool that solves all the issues that come with a hybrid publishing workflow but to try and find clever connections between different tools — open source ones as much as we can — to make it available to smaller publishers, graphic designers and institutions.
